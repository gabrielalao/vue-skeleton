## Getting started

This is a basic VueJs, Vuetify, Vue Router and Vuex skeleton written on JavaScript using async/await. Great for building a starter web app.

This project is created to help other developers create a **basic VueJS app in an easy way**. This basic example shows how powerful and simple JavaScript and VueJS can be. Do you want to contribute? Pull requests are always welcome to show more features.
